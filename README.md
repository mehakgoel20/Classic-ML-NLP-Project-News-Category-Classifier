# Classic-ML-NLP-Project-News-Category-Classifier
This project builds a news category classifier using classical NLP + ML techniques on a custom-engineered BBC News dataset. Starting with 42,000 raw RSS articles, I cleaned, deduplicated, and labeled the dataset using a custom URL-based category extraction pipeline, resulting in a high-quality 33,000-sample dataset across 8 categories.
